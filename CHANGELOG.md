CHANGELOG for AVOCADO


Version 1.1 beta

* Fixed glitches in Origami Live
* Carousel now supports vertical and horizontal orientations
* No more "drifting" issue when dragging an element
* Card patch replaces Flip. In addition to increased performance, Card offers new inputs (X Position, Y Position, and Anchor Point) and removes some unnecessary ones (Width and Height, now inferred from the size of the Front and Back images).
* New Card Info patch gives information about the state of a Card.
* Drawer patch replaces Bistable.
* Drawer Info replaces Bistable Info.
* Removed the Layer (Avocado) patch (use Layer instead).
* Updated the Phone (Avocado) patch
* New Viewer (Avocado) patch
* New installer (won't install Origami unless your configuration will prevent Avocado from running)




KNOWN ISSUES
* iOS Keyboard patch can flicker on Origami Liveâ€”this is due to a bug in Origami 2.0.1
